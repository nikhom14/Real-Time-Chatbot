## Introduction

Chatbots are becoming an essential part of user interaction in various domains, including customer service, education, and entertainment. This project aims to develop a chatbot that can respond to user queries in real-time using predefined rules. The bot will understand user inputs and provide relevant responses based on the programmed logic.

## Features

- **Rule-Based Logic**: The bot uses a set of rules to determine appropriate responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web application has a clean and simple design for easy interaction.
- **Emotion Detection**: The chatbot can recognize user emotions and adjust its responses accordingly.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: The chatbot can be accessed from any device with a web browser.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages a variety of technologies to build a robust chatbot:

- **AIML**: Used for defining the chatbot's knowledge base.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the server-side application.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For creating the front-end interface.
- **JSON**: For data interchange between the client and server.
- **Python 3**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Dialogflow**: For advanced natural language processing capabilities.
- **VSCode**: The integrated development environment used for coding.
- **Render**: For deploying the web application.
